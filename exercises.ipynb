From the graph, we notice that most developers (33,907 out of 44,087 developers) only ask one question. Only about 23.1% of the developers ask two or more questions. The number of developers that ask questions reduces exponentially as we consider a higher number of posted questions. Only 1.6% of the developers ask more than 5 questions. \n",

Only about 35.2% of the developers answer two or more questions. The number of developers that answer questions reduces expo- nentially as we consider a higher number of answers.

The number of developers that answer a substantial number of questions (> 5) is more than the number of developers that ask a substantial number of questions (> 5)—3,424 (7.8%) versus 701 (1.6%).

    "To answer this research question, we investigate the proportion of posts that various developers make that are answers to some questions. We show this in Figure 5. We notice that a majority of developers only ask questions but do not answers them (83.2%, 36,672 developers). Thus, we could divide the StackOverflow community into two groups: people that only ask questions, and those that answer one or more questions. The first group is the majority.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also note another peak in Figure 5: These are developers (2,956 of 44,087 developers), with 50-59% of posts being answers. These correspond to ideal developers that contribute answers to the community as much as requesting answers from the community."

    "To answer the fourth research question, we investigate the help graph. A help graph is a directed graph, where each developer is a node, and the node corresponding to a developer D1 is linked to that of D2 if D1 answers a question posted by D2. We would like to investigate how often two developers D1 and D2 are connected by two edges, one from D1 to D2 and the other from D2 to D1. We find that there are only a few of such developers (23 pairs). We highlight a few in Table 1. The table contains the identifiers of the helpers and helpees that reciprocate. From the result, we hypothesize that developers tend to help anyone no matter if they have helped him or her before and StackOverflow tends to benefit the community as a whole."
